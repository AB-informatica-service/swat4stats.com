"Ok, men, what we have here are some dangerous headcases, to themselves and "
"to their neighbors. Approximately an hour ago we got a tip from a public "
"phone that some cultist nut-jobs calling themselves the Taronnians intend to "
"blow their house sky high, taking a chunk of the neighborhood with them.\n"
"\n"
"The detectives ran the paper trail, which uncovered disturbing deliveries to "
"the Taronnians. Recent purchases included several suspicious chemicals, as "
"well as an ominous amount of fertilizer; we're taking this one very "
"seriously. Our caller didn't give a time or date, and hung up before we "
"could get anything else from them. We assume our leak is a recent break from "
"the cult; we are checking relatives to see if an ex-cultist has returned "
"home, but that hasn't panned out yet. Since our best information indicates "
"there's imminent danger, we're not waiting. Detectives attempted to serve "
"the warrant by surrounding the location and calling the suspects out. They "
"received no response whatsoever. \n"
"\n"
"About the Taronnians. They broke off from a separatist group up in Idaho, "
"and followed their leader, Andrew Taronne, out here. Their official name is "
"something like the Children of Taronne; they view Taronne as a combination "
"all-knowing guru and prophet. They showed up here about three years ago, "
"used cash to purchase an old apartment building needing serious rehab, and "
"moved into it en masse. They only leave the building in groups of three or "
"more, and they refuse entrance to any outsiders. \n"
"\n"
"Anything they're doing was ordered by Taronne, which means he's the one we "
"need to talk to. However, Taronne never leaves the house, so we'll be going "
"in after him. The group they split from believes in strong self defense, and "
"there's no reason to think the Taronnians have changed that tenet. Expect "
"armed resistance, and don't be surprised if even the unarmed cultists are "
"stubborn about surrendering. Keep your eyes out for any children belonging "
"to members of the cult.\n"
"\n"
"The building was a standard apartment building before the Taronnians moved "
"in, but they may have altered it. The floor plans are a guideline. Expect to "
"be surprised. Assume they have taken no precautions with their explosives. A "
"careless bullet might cause some unwanted casualties, so put some thought "
"into your gear choices for this assignment.\n"

"We have another tough one. Just before closing time, the DuPlessis Diamond "
"Center was broken into. The suspects drove a truck through the main security "
"doors into the lobby. The building's alarm was triggered immediately. "
"Witnesses report multiple suspects, armed with machine guns and wearing body "
"armor, entering the building. Witnesses also report they have not seen any "
"of the wholesaler's employees exit the building, although it was still open "
"and security personnel were on duty.\n"
"\n"
"The DuPlessis office building is built much like a small fort. Most areas "
"are under constant video surveillance. A separate security system and metal "
"detector guards access to the vault. The vault door has a time lock; it "
"locks at 1800 every night, and can't be reopened until office hours start "
"the next day at 0900. Note that the alarm company has disabled the time lock "
"on the door for us, in case the gunmen are hiding inside of it. The "
"building's phone lines were disabled by the suspects. \n"
"\n"
"DuPlessis is a wholesaler; they deal mainly in raw stones. This means they "
"haven't been cleaned or cut, and they also aren't registered. However, "
"they're harder to move; you can't take these down to the local pawnshop. "
"This week, DuPlessis was holding a shipment of finished jewels. I don't "
"think the timing is a coincidence. Our suspects probably have ties to black "
"market purchasers outside of the country, since even the finished gems are a "
"lot of gems to move.\n"
"\n"
"Our suspects have automatic weapons and body armor, so they're ready for a "
"fight. We don't know how they intended to breach the vault, which should "
"have locked automatically when the alarm went off. One possibility is inside "
"help, so stay on your toes. Most, if not all, of DuPlessis employees are "
"still inside. We don't know their current condition. Study the floor plans, "

"Get ready, men, this is a tough one. Our target Lawrence Fairfax is the "
"number one suspect in a string of grisly homicides. A bit of review: over "
"the last year and a half, seven women, all of them studying at the state "
"university, disappeared. Their remains, showing signs of torture and "
"dismemberment, reappeared anywhere from a week to three weeks later. The "
"killer was careful; the task force forensic team was unable to get a useful "
"DNA match from any of the bodies.\n"
"\n"
"That changed with the most recent find. Another victim was located earlier "
"this morning by a local laborer. Some of the DNA scrapings from her nails "
"match one of the men being investigated by the task force: Lawrence "
"Fairfax.\n"
"\n"
"There's a complication: another student, Melinda Kline, went missing "
"sometime around 2000 on October 18th. That was six days ago. If Fairfax has "
"her, and if he's following the profile, chances are good she's still alive. "
"Rescuing her is your first priority, which is why we're going in with no "
"warning.\n"
"\n"
"About our suspect. Fairfax is employed as a temporary carpenter and works "
"off and on at the University. No police record, but court records show a "
"pair of expired restraining orders against him. He's been suspended from a "
"recent jobsite for stealing supplies. Fairfax's coworkers don't say much "
"about him; he keeps to himself. He's been at the law library multiple times, "
"most notably on the days before the disappearance of three of our victims, "
"including Melinda Kline. A police interview with him was inconclusive; but "
"the detective responsible did acquire a DNA sample from a used tissue. \n"
"\n"
"Fairfax was seeing a psychiatrist when he was laid off; we've been unable to "
"access his records. The psych warned us that Fairfax may have fortified his "
"living areas. Be alert for traps, especially in spaces only Fairfax uses. He "
"lives with his mother, Gladys Fairfax. She's a recluse, and due to health "
"problems rarely leaves the house. We don't have reason to believe she's "
"involved, but stay on your toes.\n"

"Kline. Study the layout, choose your gear, get moving."

"Okay guys, listen up. OCID (Organized Crime Investigation Division) has "
"spent a lot of time setting this one up, and they've asked for our help "
"serving the arrest warrant. For the last two weeks, the Food Wall Restaurant "
"has been under close surveillance. We believe the owner, one Lian Niu, an "
"experienced gunsmith, deals in the illegal modification of firearms, in this "
"case, fabricating custom high-volume magazines. Niu maintains a residence "
"above the restaurant, and does his business there. He's been questioned "
"about illegal arms before, but walked. \n"
"\n"
"Ten minutes ago, Detective Sheary sighted Alex Jimenez entering the "
"restaurant. Look at your files; Alex Jimenez, also known as 'The Knife', is "
"a hit man with Columbian connections. He's a key suspect in multiple "
"homicides over the last year and half. Jimenez should be considered armed "
"and dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"Sheary believes that Jimenez is presently inside the business, having "
"modifications made to a MAC-10 submachine gun used in a recent homicide. We "
"want the evidence intact, so we can't give Jimenez and Niu any warning. The "
"restaurant's patrons and employees will still be in the building when you go "
"in. As always, target ID.\n"
"\n"
"Your first priority is, of course, to avoid any civilian injuries; but after "
"that, secure the gun in Jimenez's possession. OCID is looking forward to "
"having a long talk with both Jimenez and Niu - and that gun is just the "
"thing to make them chatty. So take a careful look at the floorplans, plan "
"your entry and gear up.\n"

"If you haven't heard of the Army of Faith, here's your introduction. A bit "
"after 20 hundred hours a group of them broke into the Hologen research "
"facility at Mount Threshold, closely affiliated with Mount Threshold "
"University. A couple of patrol cars responded quickly to the initial alarm, "
"and the activists were trapped inside. Unfortunately, trapped along with "
"them are the building's late working scientists and graduate students. The "
"suspects have already released a statement declaring their willingness to "
"become martyrs, and we have evidence of their willingness to make martyrs "
"out of others. It's a very touchy situation, with the potential to get "
"worse.\n"
"\n"
"About the Army of Faith. They've been around for about two years, and have "
"claimed credit for bombing research facilities doing work with stem cells "
"and cloning technology. Don't make the mistake of thinking of them as kooks. "
"Whatever they believe, they are also well armed, well trained, and dedicated "
"to their cause. They've sent - and acted on - death threats to leading "
"researchers in both fields, and this is not the first institution they've "
"invaded. \n"
"\n"
"We think they intended the same sort of high damage, high speed raid at "
"Hologen. However, university police were nearby, and acted quickly to "
"contain them. Things are still confused enough that we don't know how many "
"civilians are still in there, and we only have rough estimates on the number "
"of suspects. \n"
"\n"
"Hologen is active in DNA cloning research, and we believe that is why they "
"were targeted. Our suspects are led by Jean Trouffant. He is one of the "
"major operatives in the Army of Faith. Trouffant was wanted for bombing "
"abortion clinics, before going underground and reappearing with the Army of "
"Faith. We don't have an accurate count of how many gunmen he has with him, "
"but it's at least seven or eight, from eyewitness reports.\n"
"\n"
"One of the first things the Army of Faith did was take down the security "
"system, so we don't know how many civilians are inside. The suspects have "
"named so far only Dr. Theodore Sturgeon as a hostage. We believe he is in "
"imminent danger from the suspects, as one of Hologen's key researchers. As "
"always, your first priority is to rescue him and get any other civilians out "
"of there safely. However, you should also keep your eyes open for Sturgeon's "
"briefcase, which has contacts for other researchers around the world. In the "
"Army of Faith's hands, those documents become an open season list. Study the "
"location and your opponents, choose your gear carefully, and get in there. "
"There's a lot riding on this one.\n"

"Ok, men, this one's a zoo, and it isn't going to get any better. The self "

"Betincourt Junior and Lawrence Adams, his general contractor, hostage. "
"Apparently they were touring a current project, the Old Granite Hotel, and "
"were taken while inspecting Adams' work. Now the suspects are holed up on "
"the top two floors of the hotel, demanding twelve million dollars ransom by "

"\n"
"America Now is a small but active domestic militia group. They are fiercely "
"isolationist, opposing immigration, free trade, and foreign owned interests. "
"Most of their previous actions have been against foreign owned properties, "
"either sabotaging them in the building stage or engaging in serious "
"vandalism, making the properties too expensive to maintain. This is their "
"first kidnapping, and it may indicate a shift in the group's tactics. Given "

"publicity as well. We've spoken with the media, and received some co-"
"operation; however, it's not clear how long that will last.\n"
